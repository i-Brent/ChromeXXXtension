          A mammal can be a carnivore (meat eater),
herbivore (plant eater) or omnivore (meat and plant eater).
By looking at the teeth, eye position and feet you can
usually identify which of the three it is.
First lets look at teeth. If the mammal has long, sharp
canine teeth next to the front (incisor) teeth and also has
sharp cheek teeth (carnissials) it is a carnivore. The canines
are for seizing and stabbing prey. The carnassials help cut
up meat in the mouth.</p><p>
If the mammal has either blunt canines or no canines,
and has big flat side and back teeth (premolars and
molars) it is a herbivore. Herbivores use their molars for
crushing and grinding plants.</p><p>
But what about herbivores that do have large front
teeth? Beavers, for example, have huge front incisors. And
river hippos have two huge lower canines. Well, beavers use
their incisors for chewing through bark, branches and even
trees. And hippos use their canine tusks for defense and
fighting, not for chewing. But both beavers and hippos have
large flat molars that they use for grinding up plant matter.
If the mammal has a variety of all kinds of teeth
(canines, incisors, premolars and molars) it is an omnivore. It
has a variety of teeth because it eats a variety of foods,
both meat and plants.</p>
